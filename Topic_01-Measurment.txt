(*) This paper will focus solely on the measurement of USTs and the resulting metrics

(>) Important aspects
    A. An Overview of Aggregating Financial Assets
        - When we aggregate the entirety of the US economy, we take each item and convert
            it into a market value. We do this because we understand that no two goods/services
            are identical, and therefore we cannot simply sum up the quantity of items. 
        - Money-and financial assets more generally-can be viewed in the same light. Some assets
            are held for their liquidity properties, while others are valued for their safety,
            use as collateral, or mitigators of risk. 
        - A simple sum aggregator, like the standard M1 and M2 metrics, ignores these differences.
            That is, these measures are correct under the strong assumption that these various financial vehicles
            are perfect substitutes for one another. The fact that their yields vary accross assets and time
            is sufficient to conclude that this cannot be the case. 
        - Barnett and Chauvet (2009) provide an excellent, chronological history of the advances in
            monetary aggregation.
        - Barnett and Serletis (2000) surveys the literature. 
    B. Motivation of non-simple sum aggregator
        - Primarily going to be a literature review
            - Amahud and Mendelson (1991) regarding Bills and Notes
            (!) Replicate and expand with Notes and Bonds
        - Empirically showing that these assets are inherently different in terms of liquidity, safety, etc.
        - Need a good lit review proving the perferred habitat theory as well as other differences - Amahud and Mendelson (1991) for instance 
        - Deep dive into the literature regarding what simple-sum aggegators imply
        - Why market value aggregates don't quite capture these differences 
    C. Motivation of Fisher Ideal Index
        - DSGE model with bonds in the utilty function
        - Translog monetary-services approximation
        - Derive user cost and the Fisher Ideal index (if applicable)
    D. Data and assumptions
    E. Calculation and Presentation
    F. Implications
        - This one is particularly troublesome because it will lead to debt levels seeming larger than the simple sum
        - May need to incorporate the fiscal capacity derivation here

(>) Items for later papers
    A. What is being measured: liquidity vs safety vs collateral
        - requires three additional mechanisms for each
        - hopefully these mechanisms will show up in the user cost and I can measure them
    B. What fiscally-provided monetary services do to inflation
        - this would include the fiscal space derivations as well
    C. Monetary-Fiscal Interaction with Fiscal Monetary Services

(>) Potential Issues with this paper
    A. WHO CARES? -> Explaining why this is useful is going to be a problem.
        - Monetary aggregation literature doesn't get a lot of publicity, so why would this?
        - The other topics are going to be the crux of why this is important, but they won't be in this paper
        - Will really need to sell the problems with the metrics we currently use
