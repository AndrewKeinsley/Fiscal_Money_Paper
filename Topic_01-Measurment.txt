(*) This paper will focus solely on the measurement of USTs and the resulting metrics

(>) Important aspects
    A. Motivation of non-simple sum aggregator
        - Empirically showing that these assets are inherently different in terms of liquidity, safety, etc.
        - Need a good lit review proving the perferred habitat theory as well as other differences - Amahud and Mendelson (1991) for instance 
        - Deep dive into the literature regarding what simple-sum aggegators implicitly
        - Why market value aggregates don't quite capture these differences 
    B. Motivation of Fisher Ideal Index
        - DSGE model with bonds in the utilty function
        - Translog monetary-services approximation
        - Derive user cost and the Fisher Ideal index (if applicable)
    C. Data and assumptions
    D. Calculation and Presentation
    E. Implications
        - This one is particularly troublesome because it will lead to debt levels seeming larger than the simple sum
        - May need to incorporate the fiscal capacity derivation here

(>) Items for later papers
    A. What is being measured: liquidity vs safety vs collateral
        - requires three additional mechanisms for each
        - hopefully these mechanisms will show up in the user cost and I can measure them
    B. What fiscally-provided monetary services do to inflation
        - this would include the fiscal space derivations as well
    C. Monetary-Fiscal Interaction with Fiscal Monetary Services

(>) Potential Issues with this paper
    A. WHO CARES? -> Explaining why this is useful is going to be a problem.
        - Monetary aggregation literature doesn't get a lot of publicity, so why would this?
        - The other topics are going to be the crux of why this is important, but they won't be in this paper
        - Will really need to sell the problems with the metrics we currently use
